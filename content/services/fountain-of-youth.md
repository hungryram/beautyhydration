body_text = "Several recognized non-redoxroles: Important in cell nuclear DNA repair and telomere maintenance. NAD and NAD+ occur naturally in your body. They play a major role in the chemical process of generating energy. NAD+ is probably the most important co-factor for improving mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles (a.k.a. “energy powerhouses”) where macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats from food) are converted to energy-rich ATP molecules for the cell. NAD helps the liver break down fats that are essential to provide energy for the body. It also helps create ATP, which is a major source of energy for cells. Boosting NAD+ may help manage a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer. When NAD+ is given by IV (intravenous) or IM (intramuscular) injection, some research has shown it can improve mental clarity, alertness, concentration, and memory. Moreover, NAD+ infusions may improve athletic endurance and reverse the symptoms of chronic fatigue."
